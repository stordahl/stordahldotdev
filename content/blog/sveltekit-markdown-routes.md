title: Generate SvelteKit Routes from Markdown

Recently I prototyped a SvelteKit library that would allow you to easily generate routes from a directory of Markdown files. This is a common pattern for things like a blog or documentation site, where you want to author pages in markdown and have new markdown files automatically create routes in your application. After experimenting with this library for a while, I came to the conclusion that there's a fair bit of customization available if you simply author this code yourself. So rather than publishing the library, today I'd like to walk through how you can add this functionality to your own SvelteKit application. 

> In this tutorial, I'm not going to cover every single function, component, or CSS rule - I'm mainly going to focus on the application design patterns and core business logic. The full source code is linked at the bottom of this article.

      <h1>Third Party JavaScript Consulting</h1>
      <p>Unlock the full potential of your web applications with expert guidance on Third Party JavaScript development. Whether you're integrating APIs, widgets, or analytics tools, I'd love to work with your team to ensure modern developer experience, seamless integration, and optimized performance.</p>
     
      <h2>Why Third Party JavaScript Matters</h2>
      <p>In today's interconnected web ecosystem, leveraging Third Party JavaScript is crucial for enhancing functionality without reinventing the wheel. From embedding social media plugins to integrating complex analytics solutions, third-party scripts streamline development while enriching user experiences.</p>

      <h2>My Background</h2>
      <p>Throughout my career, I've been dealing with a lot of Third Party code. From managing Third Party Integrations for the <a href="https://hennepintech.edu/">largest technical college in Minnesota</a>, to building Third Party JavaScript applications that appear on e-commerce sites like <a href="https://stylitics.com/resources/newsroom/stylitics-maximizes-retailers-catalogs-with-automated-styling-and-outfitting-solutions-2-2/">Puma</a>, <a href="https://stylitics.com/resources/case-studies/use-case-how-stylitics-is-helping-dicks-sporting-goods-effortlessly-create-featured-shops-and-merchandising-bundles/">Dick's Sporting Goods</a>, and West Elm. The roles I've had over the past 5 years have provided me time to go deep on the problem space of Third Party JavaScript, and now I'm looking to help teams navigate this fruitful though ambiguous product market.</p>

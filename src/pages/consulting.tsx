      <h1>Third Party JavaScript Consulting</h1>
      <p>Unlock the full potential of your web software with expert guidance on Third Party JavaScript development. Whether you are looking to build SDKs, widgets, or analytics tools, I'd love to work with your team to ensure modern developer experience, seamless integration, and optimized performance.</p>
     
      <h2>Why Third Party JavaScript Matters</h2>
      <p>In today's interconnected web ecosystem, providing a Third Party JavaScript integration for your software can bring a lot of value to your business. From embedded widgets to complex analytics solutions, third-party scripts enrich user experiences while provided a platform agnostic integration target.</p>

      <h2>My Background</h2>
      <p>Throughout my career, I've been dealing with a lot of Third Party code. From managing Third Party Integrations for the <a href="https://hennepintech.edu/">largest technical college in Minnesota</a>, to building Third Party JavaScript applications that live on e-commerce sites like <a href="https://stylitics.com/resources/newsroom/stylitics-maximizes-retailers-catalogs-with-automated-styling-and-outfitting-solutions-2-2/">Puma</a> and <a href="https://stylitics.com/resources/case-studies/use-case-how-stylitics-is-helping-dicks-sporting-goods-effortlessly-create-featured-shops-and-merchandising-bundles/">Dick's Sporting Goods</a>. Currently, I'm a Product Engineer at <a href="https://stylitics.com">Stylitics</a>, which has provided me time to go deep on the problem space of Third Party JavaScript, and now I'm looking to help other teams navigate this fruitful though ambiguous product market.</p>
